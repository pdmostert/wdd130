        <p>
            I was inspired to build my own Computer Numerical Control (CNC)machine, CNC is a technology that has
            revolutionized the manufacturing industry, allowing for precision and automation in the production of
            various components and products. A CNC machine is essentially a computer-controlled cutting machine that
            uses a pre-programmed sequence of instructions to guide the cutting tools to create the desired shape and
            size of a workpiece. CNC machines can be used for a wide range of applications, from metalworking and
            woodworking to 3D printing and laser cutting. By using CNC technology, manufacturers can achieve high levels
            of accuracy and consistency while reducing the need for manual labour, resulting in faster production times
            and lower costs.
        <p>
            Overall, building your own CNC for woodworking requires extensive research and attention to detail. However,
            the information available online makes it possible for even those with limited experience to take on this
            exciting DIY project.
        </p>
        <p>The following steps guided me along the way to ensure I had a working model that best suited by needs:</p>

        <h3>Planning</h3>
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>
            Researching information from the internet and YouTube is an excellent way to learn about building your own
            CNC for woodworking. The first step is to identify reliable sources of information such as woodworking
            forums, CNC enthusiast websites, and YouTube channels dedicated to DIY CNC projects. These sources provide
            valuable information on the different types of CNC machines available, the required components and tools,
            and step-by-step instructions on how to build them.
        </p>
        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>
            Once you have gathered enough information, it is essential to analyse and compare the different options
            available to determine which one is best suited for your specific needs. This includes considering factors
            such as the size and type of wood you will be working with, the precision required for your projects, and
            your budget. It is also crucial to have a good understanding of the different types of CNC software
            available, as this will be critical in operating your machine.
        </p>
        <h2>Components</h2>

        <h3>Jigs</h3>

        <p>Creating your own jig for working with aluminium extrusions can be a great way to ensure precision and accuracy during construction. The first step is to design the jig according to the specifications of the aluminium extrusions being used in the construction of the CNC frame and bed. This includes considering the size and shape of the extrusions, as well as the required placement of the connectors.</p>
        <p>Once the jig has been designed, it can be used to slide the aluminium extrusions down the T-slot tracks and secure them in place. This helps to ensure that the extrusions are held firmly and accurately, allowing for precise drilling of the connector holes. Using the jig to hold the extrusions in place also allows for consistency in hole placement, ensuring that all connectors are positioned accurately, and the final product is structurally sound.</p>
        <p>Overall, creating a jig for working with aluminium extrusions can be an effective way to ensure accuracy and precision during construction. By designing a jig specific to the needs of your project, you can ensure that the aluminium extrusions are held firmly and accurately, allowing for precise drilling and secure connection.</p>

        <h3>The Build</h3>
        <h2>Sourcing</h2>
        <p>
            Utilizing local engineering companies to manufacture the aluminium plates for the X and Y axis of the gantry
            and Z axis can be an excellent way to ensure the quality of the components while supporting local
            businesses. The first step is to identify engineering companies in your area that specialize in the
            manufacturing of precision parts and have experience with CNC machining. Once you have identified potential
            companies, it is important to provide them with detailed specifications and drawings of the required parts,
            as well as any necessary materials.
         </p>
         <p>   
            Working with local engineering companies can provide several benefits, including the ability to visit the
            manufacturing facility to inspect the progress and quality of the parts as they are being made. This can
            help identify any potential issues early on, allowing for adjustments to be made before completion.
            Additionally, local companies may be able to offer personalized service, including consultation on design
            modifications or material selection.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, utilizing local engineering companies to manufacture precision parts for your CNC can be an
            effective way to ensure the quality of the components while supporting local businesses. By working closely
            with these companies and providing detailed specifications, you can ensure that the parts meet your exact
            needs and specifications.
        </p>

        <h2>Assembly</h2>
        <p>After selecting the best design and components for your CNC, the next step is to start building it. This
            involves assembling the frame, installing the motors and electronics, and wiring the machine. Following the
            detailed instructions provided by your chosen resources is key to ensuring that the CNC is built correctly,
            and functions as intended.</p>
