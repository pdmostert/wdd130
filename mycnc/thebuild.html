                <p>Utilizing local engineering companies to manufacture the aluminium plates for the X and Y axis of
                    the
                    gantry and Z axis can be an excellent way to ensure the quality of the components while
                    supporting
                    local businesses. The first step is to identify engineering companies in your area that
                    specialize
                    in the manufacturing of precision parts and have experience with CNC machining. Once you have
                    identified potential companies, it is important to provide them with detailed specifications and
                    drawings of the required parts, as well as any necessary materials.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Working with local engineering companies can provide several benefits, including the ability to
                    visit the manufacturing facility to inspect the progress and quality of the parts as they are
                    being
                    made. This can help identify any potential issues early on, allowing for adjustments to be made
                    before completion. Additionally, local companies may be able to offer personalized service,
                    including consultation on design modifications or material selection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, utilizing local engineering companies to manufacture precision parts for your CNC can
                    be an
                    effective way to ensure the quality of the components while supporting local businesses. By
                    working
                    closely with these companies and providing detailed specifications, you can ensure that the
                    parts
                    meet your exact needs and specifications.

                <h2>Assembly</h2>
                <p>After selecting the best design and components for your CNC, the next step is to start building
                    it.
                    This involves assembling the frame, installing the motors and electronics, and wiring the
                    machine.
                    Following the detailed instructions provided by your chosen resources is key to ensuring that
                    the
                    CNC is built correctly, and functions as intended.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Firstly I started with the legs and the sides as they was the basis, for the rest of he components
                    to connect to. I ordered the aluminum extrusion cut to length which saved me a lot of time.
                    I still had to drill the connecting holes for the fasteners using the jig. This was simple and
                    effective. Once the legs and sides were connected, I moved on to the cross members to secure the
                    two sides to each other.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At this point is was time to level the feed sides and ensure all runners were parallel.
                    This was done with a simple crisscross with string between the four corners and a level.
                    It seems simple but it is so affective and quick to complete.
                    It is very important that the base is level at this point as everything we put on top will require
                    precision.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next step was to drop on a Medium Fibre Density (MDF) board, this would become the spoiler board
                    that objected are connected to for machining. This also gave me surface to work on.
                    After connecting all the accessories such as linear rails, ball screws, motors, the gantry was
                    places on top
                    and screwed in to place. Connecting the motors to the drivers and controller was the last step of
                    assembly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First project was to use the CNC to drill about sixty holes that will connect the spoiler board to
                    the frame.
