            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>Researching information from the internet and YouTube is an excellent way to learn about building
                your own CNC for woodworking. There are many functional designs to choose from some include a fixed
                gantry, others a movable gantry. With a fixed gantry bed will move.
                Part of your planning will need to include the hight of the gantry above the bed.
                All these factors will design how ridged your CNC will be at the end.

            <img src="images/z-axis-full.jpg" alt="z axis">
            <p>The first step is to identify reliable sources of information such as woodworking forums, CNC
                enthusiast websites, and YouTube channels dedicated to DIY CNC projects. These sources provide
                valuable information on the different types of CNC machines available, the required components and
                tools, and step-by-step instructions on how to build them.
                If you have a keen eye and look tough build images on sites like this one you can gain a wealth of
                information.

            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p>Once you have gathered enough information, it is essential to analyze and compare the different
                options available to determine which one is best suited for your specific needs. This includes
                considering factors such as the size and type of wood you will be working with, the precision
                required for your projects, and your budget. It is also crucial to have a good understanding of the
                different types of CNC software available, as this will be critical in operating your machine. </p>

            <p>Creating your own jig for working with aluminum extrusions can be a great way to ensure precision
                and accuracy during construction. The first step is to design the jig according to the
                specifications of the aluminum extrusions being used in the construction of the CNC frame and bed.
                This includes considering the size and shape of the extrusions, as well as the required placement of
                the connectors.

                Once the jig has been designed, it can be used to slide the aluminum extrusions down the T-slot
                tracks and secure them in place. This helps to ensure that the extrusions are held firmly and
                accurately, allowing for precise drilling of the connector holes. Using the jig to hold the
                extrusions in place also allows for consistency in hole placement, ensuring that all connectors are
                positioned accurately, and the final product is structurally sound.

                Overall, creating a jig for working with aluminum extrusions can be an effective way to ensure
                accuracy and precision during construction. By designing a jig specific to the needs of your
                project, you can ensure that the aluminum extrusions are held firmly and accurately, allowing for
                precise drilling and secure connection.</p>
