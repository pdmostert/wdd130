                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>Researching information from the internet and YouTube is an excellent way to learn about building
                    your own CNC for woodworking. </p>

                <p>The first step is to identify reliable sources of information such as woodworking forums, CNC
                    enthusiast websites, and YouTube channels dedicated to DIY CNC projects. These sources provide
                    valuable information on the different types of CNC machines available, the required components and
                    tools, and step-by-step instructions on how to build them.</p>

                <p>Once you have gathered enough information, it is essential to analyze and compare the different
                    options available to determine which one is best suited for your specific needs. This includes
                    considering factors such as the size and type of wood you will be working with, the precision
                    required for your projects, and your budget. It is also crucial to have a good understanding of the
                    different types of CNC software available, as this will be critical in operating your machine. </p>

                <p>Creating your own jig for working with aluminum extrusions can be a great way to ensure precision
                    and accuracy during construction. The first step is to design the jig according to the
                    specifications of the aluminum extrusions being used in the construction of the CNC frame and bed.
                    This includes considering the size and shape of the extrusions, as well as the required placement of
                    the connectors.

                    Once the jig has been designed, it can be used to slide the aluminum extrusions down the T-slot
                    tracks and secure them in place. This helps to ensure that the extrusions are held firmly and
                    accurately, allowing for precise drilling of the connector holes. Using the jig to hold the
                    extrusions in place also allows for consistency in hole placement, ensuring that all connectors are
                    positioned accurately, and the final product is structurally sound.

                    Overall, creating a jig for working with aluminum extrusions can be an effective way to ensure
                    accuracy and precision during construction. By designing a jig specific to the needs of your
                    project, you can ensure that the aluminum extrusions are held firmly and accurately, allowing for
                    precise drilling and secure connection.</p>
